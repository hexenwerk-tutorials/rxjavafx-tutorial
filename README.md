# RxJavaFx tutorial
RxJavaFx is merely a layer between JavaFx and RxJava technologies.
### Preface
JavaFx brought a new concepts of **Binding**s and **ObservableValue**s. The idea of events triggering other events, and a value notifying another value of its changes seems to be very promising.
But after studying JavaFx deeper one may become discontent. JavaFx does have **Binding** functionality that can synchronize properties and events of different controls, but the ability to express transformations is pretty limited.

Reactive programming brings means for simple and intuitive data processing between synchronized properties. And goes far beyond that. It extends the observer pattern to support sequences of data and/or events and allows you to compose sequences together while abstracting away concerns about things like low-level threading, synchronization, thread-safety, concurrent data structures, and non-blocking I/O.
### RxJava
As mentioned before RxJavaFx is just a bridge between RxJava and JavaFx. To get the idea behind the technology we need to start from Rx.

RxJava has two core types: **Observable** and **Observer**. 
In the simplest definition **Observable** pushes things, a given **Observable\<T>** will push items of type **T** through a series of operators that form other **Observable**s and finally the terminal **Observer** is what consumes the items at the end of the chain. Each pushed T item is known as an emission.

    Observable<Integer> emissionsSource = Observable.just(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
As you may have noticed the form of the factory is Stream alike.

    Stream<Integer> numbersStream = Stream.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
Where possible I will try to yield Stream counterpart to emphasize that we already know the external mechnics of basic Observable operators.

**Observer** is composed out of three methods:
```java
new ResourceObserver<T>() {

	@Override
	public void onNext(T t) {
		//is called to pass the emission
	}

	@Override
	public void onError(Throwable e) {
		//is called when exception occured
	}

	@Override
	public void onComplete() {
		//is called when there are no more emissions
	}
};
```
Lets get one with some examples.

    Observable<Integer> emissionsSource = Observable.just(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
	emissionsSource.subscribe(number -> System.out.println("number=" + number));
[Example001](https://github.com/pkrysztofiak/rxjavafx-tutorial/blob/master/src/main/java/com/github/pkrysztofiak/rxjavafxtutorial/examples/Example001.java)

Produces an output:

    number=1    
    number=2    
    number=3    
    number=4    
    number=5

After subscribing to an Observable it starts to produce an emissions which are handled by the Observer. The Observer we deal with is called finite or cold. In oposition to hot Observables it has predefined number of emissions and in consequence will call Observer onComplete() method when all emissions are passed.
For now just note RxJava has no notion of parallelization, and when you subscribe to a factory like Observable.just(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) , you will always get those emissions serially, in that exact order, and on a single thread.

### Operators
Let us do something a little more useful than just connecting a source
Observable and an Observer . Let's put some operators between them to
actually transform emissions and do work. In RxJava, you can use hundreds of operators to transform emissions and create new Observables with those transformations.
#### map()
 For instance, you can create an Observable\<Integer> off an Observable<String> by using the map() operator, and use it to emit each String's length. The *lettersObservable* Observable pushes each String to the map() operator where it is mapped to its length . That length is then pushed from the map() operator to the Observer where it is printed.
```java
Observable<String> lettersObservable = Observable.just("Alpha", "Beta", "Gamma", "Delta", "Epsilon");

lettersObservable
.map(letter -> letter.length())
.subscribe(length -> System.out.println("length=" + length));
```
[Example002](https://github.com/pkrysztofiak/rxjavafx-tutorial/blob/master/src/main/java/com/github/pkrysztofiak/rxjavafxtutorial/examples/Example002.java)

Produces output:

    length=5    
    length=4    
    length=5    
    length=5    
    length=7

#### doOnNext()
Is a debug operator. Passes emission but does nothing with it.
```java
Observable<String> numbersObservable = Observable.just("one", "two", "three");
numbersObservable
.doOnNext(next -> System.out.println("next=" + next))
.map(String::length)
.subscribe(length -> System.out.println("length=" + length));
```
[Example003](https://github.com/pkrysztofiak/rxjavafx-tutorial/blob/master/src/main/java/com/github/pkrysztofiak/rxjavafxtutorial/examples/Example003.java)

Produces output:

    next=one
    length=3
    next=two
    length=3
    next=three
    length=5

#### filter()
Another common operator is filter() , which suppresses emissions that fail to
meet a certain criteria, and pushes the ones that do forward.
```java
Observable.just("one", "two", "three", "four", "five")
.filter(next -> next.length() > 3)
.subscribe(next -> System.out.println("next=" + next));
```
[Example004](https://github.com/pkrysztofiak/rxjavafx-tutorial/blob/master/src/main/java/com/github/pkrysztofiak/rxjavafxtutorial/examples/Example004.java)

Produces output:

    next=three
    next=four
    next=five
#### distinct()
There are also operators like distinct() , which will suppress emissions that
have previously been emitted to prevent duplicate emissions (based on each
emission's hashcode() / equals() implementation).
```java
Observable.just("one", "two", "three", "four", "five")
.map(String::length)
.distinct()
.subscribe(System.out::println);
```
[Example005](https://github.com/pkrysztofiak/rxjavafx-tutorial/blob/master/src/main/java/com/github/pkrysztofiak/rxjavafxtutorial/examples/Example005.java)

Produces output:

    3
    5
    4
You can also provide a lambda specifying an attribute of each emitted item to distinct on, rather than the item itself.
```java
Observable.just("one", "two", "three", "four", "five")
.distinct(String::length)
.subscribe(System.out::println);
```
[Example006](https://github.com/pkrysztofiak/rxjavafx-tutorial/blob/master/src/main/java/com/github/pkrysztofiak/rxjavafxtutorial/examples/Example006.java)

Produces output:

    one
    three
    four
#### distinctUntilChanged()
Will not supress only if current emission is different from the last one.
```java
Observable.just("one", "one", "two", "one", "seven", "eight", "eight", "nine")
.distinctUntilChanged()
.subscribe(System.out::println);
```
[Example007](https://github.com/pkrysztofiak/rxjavafx-tutorial/blob/master/src/main/java/com/github/pkrysztofiak/rxjavafxtutorial/examples/Example007.java)

Produces output:

    one
    two
    one
    seven
    eight
    nine
#### take()
The take() operator will cut off at a fixed number of emissions and then unsubscribe from the source. Afterwards, it will call onComplete() downstream to the final Observer.
```java
Observable.just("one", "two", "three", "four", "five")
.take(3)
.subscribe(
		next -> System.out.println("next=" + next), //onNext
		throwable -> throwable.printStackTrace(),	//onError
		() -> System.out.println("completed!")		//onComplete
		);
```
[Example008](https://github.com/pkrysztofiak/rxjavafx-tutorial/blob/master/src/main/java/com/github/pkrysztofiak/rxjavafxtutorial/examples/Example008.java)

Produces output:

    next=one
    next=two
    next=three
    completed!
#### takeWhile()
takeWhile() will do something similar to take() , but specifies a lambda condition which, if not satisfied will unsubscribe from the Observer.
```java
Observable.just("one", "two", "three", "four", "five")
.takeWhile(number -> number.length() == 3)
.subscribe(
		next -> System.out.println("next=" + next), //onNext
		throwable -> throwable.printStackTrace(),	//onError
		() -> System.out.println("completed!")		//onComplete
		);
```
[Example009](https://github.com/pkrysztofiak/rxjavafx-tutorial/blob/master/src/main/java/com/github/pkrysztofiak/rxjavafxtutorial/examples/Example009.java)

Produces output:

    next=one
    next=two
    completed!
#### takeUntil()
takeUntil() will do something similar to take() , but specifies a lambda condition which, if satisfied will unsubscribe from the Observer after pushing the emission which caused unsubscribing.
```java
Observable.just("one", "two", "three", "four", "five")
.takeUntil((String number) -> number.startsWith("f"))
.subscribe(
		next -> System.out.println("next=" + next), //onNext
		throwable -> throwable.printStackTrace(),	//onError
		() -> System.out.println("completed!")		//onComplete
		);
```
[Example010](https://github.com/pkrysztofiak/rxjavafx-tutorial/blob/master/src/main/java/com/github/pkrysztofiak/rxjavafxtutorial/examples/Example010.java)

Produces output:

    next=one
    next=two
    next=three
    next=four
    completed!
#### count()
Some operators will aggregate the emissions in some form, and then push that aggregation as a single emission to the Observer. Obviously, this requires the onComplete() to be called so that the aggregation can be finalized and pushed to the Observer.
The count() actually returns a Single , which is a specialized Observable type that only emits one item. The Single does not have an onNext or onComplete , but rather an onSuccess event which passes the single item. If you ever need to turn a Single back into an Observable (so it works with certain Observable operators), just call its toObservable() method.
```java
Observable.just("one", "two", "three", "four", "five")
.count()
.subscribe(
		result -> System.out.println("onSucces=" + result), //onSuccess
		throwable -> throwable.printStackTrace()			//onError
		);
```
[Example011](https://github.com/pkrysztofiak/rxjavafx-tutorial/blob/master/src/main/java/com/github/pkrysztofiak/rxjavafxtutorial/examples/Example011.java)

Produces output:

    onSucces=5
#### toList()
The toList() is similar to the count() , and it also will yield a Single
rather than an Observable . It will collect the emissions until its onComplete()
is called. After that it will push an entire List containing all the emissions to the
Observer .
```java
Observable.just("one", "two", "three", "four", "five")
.toList()
.subscribe(
		list -> System.out.println("onSucces=" + list), //onSuccess
		throwable -> throwable.printStackTrace()		//onError
		);
```
[Example012](https://github.com/pkrysztofiak/rxjavafx-tutorial/blob/master/src/main/java/com/github/pkrysztofiak/rxjavafxtutorial/examples/Example012.java)

Produces output:

    onSucces=[one, two, three, four, five]
#### reduce()
When you need to do a custom aggregation or reduction, you can use reduce() to achieve this in most cases (to aggregate into collections and other mutable structures, you can use its cousin collect() ). This will return a Single (if a "seed" value is provided) or a Maybe (if no "seed" value is provided). But say we wanted the sum of all lengths for all emissions. Starting with a seed value of zero, we can use a lambda specifying how to "fold" the emissions into a single value.
```java
Observable.just("one", "two", "three")
.map(String::length)
.reduce(0, (current, next) -> current + next)
.subscribe(new SingleObserver<Integer>() {

	@Override
	public void onSubscribe(Disposable disposable) {
	}

	@Override
	public void onSuccess(Integer single) {
		System.out.println("sum=" + single);
	}

	@Override
	public void onError(Throwable throwable) {
	}
});
```
[Example013](https://github.com/pkrysztofiak/rxjavafx-tutorial/blob/master/src/main/java/com/github/pkrysztofiak/rxjavafxtutorial/examples/Example013.java)

Produces output:

    sum=11
```java    
Observable.just("one", "two", "three")
.map(String::length)
.reduce((current, next) -> current + next)
.subscribe(new MaybeObserver<Integer>() {

	@Override
	public void onSubscribe(Disposable disposable) {
	}

	@Override
	public void onSuccess(Integer single) {
		System.out.println("sum=" + single);
	}

	@Override
	public void onError(Throwable e) {
	}

	@Override
	public void onComplete() {
		System.out.println("completed!");
	}
});
```
[Example014](https://github.com/pkrysztofiak/rxjavafx-tutorial/blob/master/src/main/java/com/github/pkrysztofiak/rxjavafxtutorial/examples/Example014.java)

Produces output:

    sum=11
As we can see onComplete() method was not called. It would be called if Observable does not produce any emission.
```java
Observable.<String>empty()
.map(String::length)
.reduce((current, next) -> current + next)
.subscribe(new MaybeObserver<Integer>() {

	@Override
	public void onSubscribe(Disposable disposable) {
	}

	@Override
	public void onSuccess(Integer single) {
		System.out.println("sum=" + single);
	}

	@Override
	public void onError(Throwable e) {
	}

	@Override
	public void onComplete() {
		System.out.println("completed!");
	}
});
```
[Example015](https://github.com/pkrysztofiak/rxjavafx-tutorial/blob/master/src/main/java/com/github/pkrysztofiak/rxjavafxtutorial/examples/Example015.java)

Produces output:

    completed!
#### scan()
The reduce() will push a single aggregated value derived from all the emissions. If you want to push the "running total" for each emission, you can use scan() instead. This can work with infinite Observables since it will push each accumulation for each emission, rather than waiting for all emissions to be accumulated.
```java
Observable.just("one", "two", "three")
.map(String::length)
.scan(0, (current, next) -> current + next)
.subscribe(System.out::println);
```
[Example016](https://github.com/pkrysztofiak/rxjavafx-tutorial/blob/master/src/main/java/com/github/pkrysztofiak/rxjavafxtutorial/examples/Example016.java)

Produces output:

    0
    3
    6
    11
#### flatMap()
The flatMap() is similar to map() , but will map the emission to another set of emissions via another Observable . This is one of the most powerful operators in RxJava and is full of use cases, but for now we will just stick with a simple example.
Say we have some String emissions where each contains concatenated numbers separated by semicolon. We want to break up these numbers into separate emissions (and omit the semicolons). You can call split() on each String and specify splitting on the semicolons, and this will return an array of the separated String values. Then you can turn that array into an Observable inside the flatMap().
```java
Observable.just("1;2;3", "1;1", "4;4;1;2")
.flatMap(numbers -> Observable.fromArray(numbers.split(";")))
.map(Integer::valueOf)
.reduce((current, next) -> current + next)
.subscribe(System.out::println);
```
[Example017](https://github.com/pkrysztofiak/rxjavafx-tutorial/blob/master/src/main/java/com/github/pkrysztofiak/rxjavafxtutorial/examples/Example017.java)

Produces output:

    19
#### flatMapSingle()
flatMapSingle() can be used to flatMap() to a Single, and flatMapMaybe() to a Maybe. This saves you the step of having to call toObservable() on each resulting Maybe or Single. If we wanted to sum each set of numbers, we would do it like this since this reduce() will yield a Single.
```java
Observable.just("1;2;3", "1;1", "4;4;1;2")
.flatMapSingle(numbers ->
	Observable.fromArray(numbers.split(";"))
	.map(Integer::valueOf)
	.reduce(0, (current, next) -> current + next))
.subscribe(System.out::println);
```
[Example018](https://github.com/pkrysztofiak/rxjavafx-tutorial/blob/master/src/main/java/com/github/pkrysztofiak/rxjavafxtutorial/examples/Example018.java)

Produces output:

    6
    2
    11

#### Tasks
Let's say we run a company with clients spread around the Poland. Our reps visit clients and sell them our product. Every trip made by the rep is logged as route.
```java
public class Client {
	private final String name;
	private final String city;
	private final int itemsSold;

	public Client(String name, String city, int itemsSold) {
		this.name = name;
		this.city = city;
		this.itemsSold = itemsSold;
	}
	public String getName() {
		return name;
	}
	public String getCity() {
		return city;
	}
	public int getItemsSold() {
		return itemsSold;
	}
}

public class Route {
	private final List<Client> clients = new ArrayList<>();

	public Route(Client... clients) {
		this.clients.addAll(Arrays.asList(clients));
	}
	public List<Client> getClients() {
		return clients;
	}
}    
```
Task1
Having last two routes of company representative, print the number of different cities he/she visited.
Expected output:

    4
Task2
Having last two routes of company representative, print subsequent cities he/she visited. Each route should start with "\==route==" line.
Expected output:

    ==route==
    Lodz
    Warsaw
    Poznan
    ==route==
    Lodz
    Poznan
    Gdansk
    Poznan
Task3
Having last two routes of company representative, print the total number of items sold for each route.
Expected output:

    215
    240
### Events Observable    
So far we just pushed data out of Observables. But did you know you can push events too? As stated earlier, data and events are basically the same thing in RxJava. Let's take a simple JavaFX Application with a single Button.
```java
Button button = new Button("Click me!");
stage.setScene(new Scene(button));
stage.show();

JavaFxObservable.actionEventsOf(button).subscribe(actionEvent -> {
	System.out.println(actionEvent.getClass().getName() + "@" + Integer.toHexString(System.identityHashCode(actionEvent)));
});
button.setOnAction(actionEvent -> {
	System.out.println(actionEvent.getClass().getName() + "@" + Integer.toHexString(System.identityHashCode(actionEvent)));
});
```
Example019

On every button click produces output:

    javafx.event.ActionEvent@2a2e1055
    javafx.event.ActionEvent@2a2e1055
As you can see the event object is the same.
Moreover, did we just treat the ActionEvent like any other emission and push it through the Observable? Yes we did! As said earlier, this is the powerful part of RxJava. It treats events and data the same way, and you can use all the operators we covered earlier. 
Task4
For example, we can use scan() to push how many times the Button was pressed, and push that into a Label . Just map() each ActionEvent to a 1 to drive increments.
#### Cold vs. hot observables
The Observable\<ActionEvent> we created off a Button is an example of a hot Observable . Earlier, all of our examples emitting Integer and String items are cold Observables. So what is the difference?
Remember this source Observable that simply pushes five String emissions?

    Observable.just("one", "two", "three", "four", "five")
What do you think will happen if we subscribe() to it twice? Let's try it out.
```java
	Observable<String> source = Observable.just("one", "two", "three", "four", "five");
	source.subscribe(next -> System.out.println("[Observer1] next=" + next));
	source.subscribe(next -> System.out.println("[Observer2] next=" + next))
```
Example020

Produces output:

    [Observer1] next=one
    [Observer1] next=two
    [Observer1] next=three
    [Observer1] next=four
    [Observer1] next=five
    [Observer2] next=one
    [Observer2] next=two
    [Observer2] next=three
    [Observer2] next=four
    [Observer2] next=five
Emissions are replayed for each Observer .	
With a Cold Observable, every Observer independently receives all the emissions regardless of when they Subscribe. There is no notion of timing making an impact to which emissions they receive. Cold Observables are often used to "play" data independently to each Observer . This is like giving every Observer a music CD to play, and they can independently play all the tracks. Hot Observables, however, will simultaneously push emissions to all Observers at the same time. Logically, an effect of this is Observers that come later and have missed previous emissions will not receive them. They will only get emissions going forward from the time they subscribe() . Instead of a music CD, Hot Observables are more like radio stations. They will broadcast a given song (emission) to all listeners (Observers) at the same time. If a listener misses a song, they missed it. While data and events are the same in RxJava, Hot Observables are often used to represent events, such as an Observable\<ActionEvent> built off a Button.
#### Unsubscribing
There is one last operation we need to cover: unsubscribing. Unsubscription should happen automatically for finite Observables once onComplete() is called. But for infinite or long-running Observables, there will be times you want to stop the emissions and cancel the entire operation. This will also free up resources in the Observable chain and clean up any resources it was using.
If you want to disconnect an Observer from an Observable so it stops receiving emissions, there are a couple ways to do this. The easiest way is to note the subscribe() method returns a Disposable object. This represents the connection between the Observable and the Observer , and you can call dispose() on it at any time to dispose the connections so no more emissions are pushed.
For instance, let's take our incrementing Button example from earlier and add another Button that will unsubscribe the emissions. We need to save the Disposable returned from the subscribe() method, and then we can refer to it later to call dispose() and stop emissions.

```java
	Button button = new Button("+");
	Label label = new Label();
	Button unsubscribeButton = new Button("Unsubscribe!");
	HBox hBox = new HBox(button, label, unsubscribeButton);
	stage.setScene(new Scene(hBox));
	stage.show();

	Disposable disposable = JavaFxObservable.actionEventsOf(button)
	.map(actionEvent -> 1)
	.scan(0, (current, next) -> current + next)
	.map(String::valueOf)
	.subscribe(
			label::setText,
			Throwable::printStackTrace,
			() -> System.out.println("completed!"));

	JavaFxObservable.actionEventsOf(unsubscribeButton).subscribe(next -> disposable.dispose());
```
Example021

Note that when you press the "Unsubscribe" Button , the increments stop because the Observer was disposed, and it instructed the Observable to stop sending emissions. Disposal automatically happens with finite Observables once onComplete() is called. But with infinite or long-running Observables, you need to manage their disposal if you intend to terminate them at some point. When you have infinite Observables that need to be disposed, it is very critical to call dispose() on any Disposables when you are done with them. If you do not do this, you will run into memory leak problems and the garbage collector will not be able to free those resources.
#### takeUntil()
Using line
```java
    JavaFxObservable.actionEventsOf(unsubscribeButton).subscribe(next -> disposable.dispose());
```
we called dispose() method to cancel a subscription to our Observable. But we can also unsubscribe in more reactive way.
```java
Button button = new Button("+");
Label label = new Label();
Button unsubscribeButton = new Button("Unsubscribe!");
HBox hBox = new HBox(button, label, unsubscribeButton);
stage.setScene(new Scene(hBox));
stage.show();

Observable<ActionEvent> unsubscribeButtonActionObservable = JavaFxObservable.actionEventsOf(unsubscribeButton).take(1);
Observable<ActionEvent> incrementButtonActionObservable = JavaFxObservable.actionEventsOf(button).takeUntil(unsubscribeButtonActionObservable);

incrementButtonActionObservable
.map(actionEvent -> 1)
.scan(0, (current, next) -> current + next)
.map(String::valueOf)
.subscribe(
		label::setText,
		Throwable::printStackTrace,
		() -> System.out.println("completed!"));
```
Example022

Notice that this time onComplete() method was called.
### Events and value changes
In the previous section, we got a brief introduction to handling events reactively. But RxJavaFX is equipped to handle almost any event type for various Node controls. JavaFX also utilizes the ObservableValue, and its value changes can be turned into Observables as well.
To create an Observable for any event on any Node , you can target the Node 's events using a JavaFxObservable.eventsOf(). You can pass the EventType you are targeting as a parameter, and an Observable emitting that EventType will be returned.
Here is an example with a ListView containing String items representing the integers 0 through 9. Whenever a numeric key is pressed on your keyboard, it will select that item in the ListView.
```java
ListView<String> listView = new ListView<>(FXCollections.observableArrayList(IntStream.range(0, 10).boxed().map(String::valueOf).collect(Collectors.toList())));
Scene scene = new Scene(listView);
stage.setScene(scene);
stage.show();

listView.requestFocus();

JavaFxObservable.eventsOf(listView, KeyEvent.KEY_TYPED)
.map(KeyEvent::getCharacter)
.filter(character -> character.matches("[0-9]"))
.subscribe(listView.getSelectionModel()::select);
```
Example023

Task005
Write an app which prints x and y coordinates of mouse clicked to appropriate labels.
### ObservableValue changes
Up to this point we only have worked with events. There is some metadata on event emissions that can be useful, but we are not quite working with data in the traditional sense.
JavaFX has many implementations of its ObservableValue<T> type. This is essentially a wrapper around a mutable value of a type T , and it notifies any listeners when the value changes. This provides a perfect opportunity to hook a listener onto it and make a reactive stream of value changes.
Let's create a simple ComboBox and hook up to it's value property.
```java
ComboBox<String> comboBox = new ComboBox<>(FXCollections.observableArrayList("Alpha", "Beta", "Gamma", "Delta", "Epsilon"));
StackPane stackPane = new StackPane(comboBox);
Scene scene = new Scene(stackPane, 400, 400);
stage.setScene(scene);
stage.show();
JavaFxObservable.valuesOf(comboBox.valueProperty()).subscribe(System.out::println);
```
Example024

Every selection change should produce output in a from of new value printed to console.
Let's modify our example a little and selected some value before running our subscription mechanism.
```java
ComboBox<String> comboBox = new ComboBox<>(FXCollections.observableArrayList("Alpha", "Beta", "Gamma", "Delta", "Epsilon"));
StackPane stackPane = new StackPane(comboBox);
Scene scene = new Scene(stackPane, 400, 400);
stage.setScene(scene);
stage.show();
comboBox.setValue("Gamma");
JavaFxObservable.valuesOf(comboBox.valueProperty()).subscribe(System.out::println);
```
Example025
After running the app the output is:

    Gamma
Rx emmited current value as a first thing after the subscription started.
Notice that the Example023 Rx did not push the initial null value. This is because RxJava 2 does not emit null values. However, you can use nullableValuesOf() to get the null values wrapped within Optional object.
```java
ComboBox<String> comboBox = new ComboBox<>(FXCollections.observableArrayList("Alpha", "Beta", "Gamma", "Delta", "Epsilon"));
StackPane stackPane = new StackPane(comboBox);
Scene scene = new Scene(stackPane, 400, 400);
stage.setScene(scene);
stage.show();
JavaFxObservable.nullableValuesOf(comboBox.valueProperty()).subscribe(optional -> System.out.println(optional.orElse("N/A")));
```
Example026

Task006
Let's get a little bit creative. Sum every selected value length and show it to the user in the label.
This example may be a bit contrived, but hopefully you are starting to see some of the possibilities when you have a chain of operators "reacting" to a change in a ComboBox . Pushing each value every time it is selected in a ComboBox allows you to quickly tell other parts of the UI to update accordingly.
Again, you can use this factory on any ObservableValue . This means you can hook into any JavaFX component property and track its changes reactively. The possibilities are quite vast.
#### changesOf()
You also have the option of pushing the old and new value in a Change item through the changesOf() factory. This can be helpful for validation, and you can restore that old value back into the control if the new value fails to meet a condition.
```java
TextField textField = new TextField();
Scene scene = new Scene(textField);
stage.setScene(scene);
stage.show();
JavaFxObservable.changesOf(textField.textProperty())
.map(change -> change.getNewVal().matches("[0-9]*") ? change.getNewVal() : change.getOldVal())
.subscribe(textField::setText);
```
Example027

### Collections and data
Any sizable application needs to work with data and collections of items. One of the greatest utilities to come out of JavaFX are ObservableCollections such as ObservableList , ObservableSet, and ObservableMap . These implementations of List , Set , and Map are built specifically for JavaFX to notify the UI when it has been modified, and any control built off it will visually update accordingly.
These ObservableCollections can have custom listeners added to them. This creates an opportunity to reactively work with data through collections. The idea of emitting a collection every time it changes allows some surprisingly useful reactive transformations, and we will see plenty of examples in this section.
#### emitOnChanged()
Let's create a simple application backed by an ObservableList of Strings. There will be a ListView\<String> to display these values, and another ListView\<Integer> that will hold their lengths. We will use a TextField and a Button to add Strings to the ObservableList , and both ListViews should update accordingly with each addition.
##### Example028
```java
ListView<String> listView = new ListView<>();
ListView<Integer> lenghtsListView = new ListView<>();
HBox hBox = new HBox(listView, lenghtsListView);
TextField textField = new TextField();
Button button = new Button("Add");
HBox hBox2 = new HBox(textField, button);
VBox vBox = new VBox(hBox, hBox2);
Scene scene = new Scene(vBox);
stage.setScene(scene);
stage.show();

JavaFxObservable.actionEventsOf(button).map(event -> textField.getText()).subscribe(text -> {
	listView.getItems().add(text);
	textField.setText("");
});

JavaFxObservable.emitOnChanged(listView.getItems())
.flatMapSingle(items -> Observable.fromIterable(items).map(String::length).toList())
.subscribe(lenghtsListView.getItems()::setAll);
```
Go ahead, type in "Detla", click Add button, type in "Beta", click Add button. As the list of items was changed twice there were two emissions already. Let's focus on the latter. The emisson contains all items that currently are held in the ListView\<String>. Inside flatMapSingle() we transform it using Observable.fromIterable() which creates a finite (cold) Observable. Values "Delta" and "Beta" are emitted, mapped to its lenghts and grouped toList(). After that the Observable is done, we can kind of say it's onSucccess() method was call and it emitted list of lengths as its single and final emission.
What we have really done it this example is combining the features of hot and Observables to achive desired behaviour.
##### Task007
Modify the previous example to show in the ListView\<Integer> only distinct lenghts in the ascending order.
### Add, remove, ad update events
There are factories for ObservableList , ObservableSet , and ObservableMap to emit specific change events against those collections.
#### additionsOf()
##### Example029
```java
ObservableList<String> numbers = FXCollections.observableArrayList();
JavaFxObservable.additionsOf(numbers)
.subscribe(System.out::println);
numbers.add("one");
numbers.addAll("two", "three");
```	
Produces output:

    one
    two
    three
Note that this factory has no initial emission. It will only emit additions going forward after subscription. The idea of removalsOf() is pretty the same.
#### updatesOf()
An UPDATED emission occurs when an ObservableValue property of a T item in an ObservableList\<T> changes. Consider a User class with an updateable Property called name.
##### Example030
```java
class User {

	private final StringProperty nameProperty = new SimpleStringProperty();

	public User(String name) {
		nameProperty.set(name);
	}
	public void setName(String name) {
		nameProperty.set(name);
	}
	public StringProperty nameProperty() {
		return nameProperty;
	}
	@Override
	public String toString() {
		return "User[name=" + nameProperty.get() + "]";
	}
}
```
```java
User john = new User("John");
User lucy = new User("Lucy");

ObservableList<User> users = FXCollections.observableArrayList(user -> new ObservableValue[] {user.nameProperty()});
users.addAll(john, lucy);

JavaFxObservable.updatesOf(users).subscribe(System.out::println);

john.setName("Johnny");
lucy.setName("Lucinda");
```
Produces output:

    User[name=Johnny]
    User[name=Lucinda]
Whenever this name property for any User changes, this change will be pushed as an emission.
## Combining Observables
There are several ways to combine emissions from multiple Observables, and we will cover many of these combine operators.
#### concat()
One of the simplest ways to combine Observables is to use the concat() operators. You can specify two or more Observables emitting the same type T and it will fire emissions from each one in order.
```java
Observable<String> source1 = Observable.just("one", "two");
Observable<String> source2 = Observable.just("three", "four", "five");

Observable.concat(source1, source2)
.map(String::length)
.toList()
.subscribe(System.out::println);
```
Example031

Produces output:

    [3, 3, 5, 4, 4]
It is very critical to note that onComplete() must be called by each Observable so it moves on to the next one. If you have an infinite Observable in a concatenated operation, it will hold up the line by infinitely emitting items, forever keeping any Observables after it from getting fired. Concatentation is also available as an operator and not just a factory, and it should yield the same output.
##### Example032
```java
Observable<String> source1 = Observable.just("one", "two");
Observable<String> source2 = Observable.just("three", "four", "five");

source1.concatWith(source2)
.map(String::length)
.toList()
.subscribe(System.out::println);
```
Produces output:

    [3, 3, 5, 4, 4]
#### startWith()
If you want to do a concenation but put another Observable in front rather than after, you can use startWith() instead.
##### Example033
```java
Observable<String> source1 = Observable.just("one", "two");
Observable<String> source2 = Observable.just("three", "four", "five");

source2.startWith(source1)
.map(String::length)
.toList()
.subscribe(System.out::println);
```
Produces output:

    [3, 3, 5, 4, 4]
But we can also use startWith() to force the first emssion without latter Observable involved.
##### Example034
```java
	Observable<String> source1 = Observable.just("two", "three");

	source1.startWith("one")
	.map(String::length)
	.toList()
	.subscribe(System.out::println);
```
#### merge()
Merging is almost like concatenation but with one important difference: it will combine all Observables of a given emission type T simultaneously. This means all emissions from all Observables are merged together at once into a single stream without any regard for order or completion.
##### Task008
Create app with label, decrement button and increment button. Every decrement button click should decrement the label value, increment button click increments label value. Use merge() and predefined observables.
#### combineLatest()
Reflects combined  state of every Observable composed with the operator. 
Pushes first combined emission when every of composed Observables already have sent at least one emission. After that pushes on any of Observables emission so it always reflects combined contents of every Observable composed.
##### Task009
Create app with label showing current position of stage (x, y, width, height). Use combineLatest() and predefined Observables.
#### withLatestFrom()
Is an operator counterpart of combineLatest() factory.

    observable1.withLatestFrom(observable2)

is triggerd only by observable1 emission reflecting the state of both.
##### Task010
Write an app which reflects state of delta x and delta y between mouse pressed an mouse dragged positions. Show it in xLabel, yLabel. On mouse released labels should be cleared. Use predefined Observables.
### switchMap()
The switchMap() works identically to any variant of flatMap() , but it will only chase after the last Observable emission.
Let's have an employee class
```java
public class Employee {
	private final StringProperty nameProperty = new SimpleStringProperty();
	private final Observable<String> nameObservable = JavaFxObservable.valuesOf(nameProperty);

	public Employee(String name) {
		nameProperty.set(name);
	}

	public String getName() {
		return nameProperty.get();
	}
	public void setName(String name) {
		nameProperty.set(name);
	}
	public StringProperty nameProperty() {
		return nameProperty;
	}
	public Observable<String> nameObservable() {
		return nameObservable;
	}
}
```
Let's create list of three employees and flatMap to their nameProperty.
##### Example035
```java
Employee john = new Employee("John");
Employee emily = new Employee("Emily");
Employee alastair = new Employee("Alastair");

Observable.just(john, emily, alastair)
.flatMap(employee -> employee.nameObservable())
.subscribe(System.out::println);

john.setName("Johnny");
emily.setName("Em");
alastair.setName("Al");
```
Produces output:

    John
    Emily
    Alastair
    Johnny
    Em
    Al
As you can see every Observable we created with the flatMap is stil alive and produces emissions.
##### Example036
```java
Employee john = new Employee("John");
Employee emily = new Employee("Emily");
Employee alastair = new Employee("Alastair");

Observable.just(john, emily, alastair)
.switchMap(employee -> employee.nameObservable())
.subscribe(System.out::println);

john.setName("Johnny");
emily.setName("Em");
alastair.setName("Al");

john.setName("Johnny the First");
emily.setName("Em the Greatest");
alastair.setName("Al the Looser");
```
Produces output:

    John
    Emily
    Alastair
    Al
    Al the Looser

As you can see only the last Observable produces emissions.
##### Task011
Let's build a simple form app with employees represented as buttons. Employees's button clicked selects the employee and fills the form with the employee's data. Inside the form we can edit the employee's description. Every modification updates external system.
But application has one big flaw. It sends the updates of description to external system, but on the external system side we have no idea from which employee this update originates from. Fix the app so it calls ExternalSystem.updateDescription(Employee employee) method.
##### Task012
Write circle dragger app.
## Concurrency
#### subscribeOn()
By default, for a given Observable chain, the thread that calls the subscribe() method is the thread the Observable sends emissions on. For instance, a simple subscription to an Observable inside a main() method will fire the emissions on the main daemon thread.
```java
Observable.just("one", "two", "three")
.subscribe(next -> System.out.println("[" + Thread.currentThread().getName() + "] next=" + next));
```
Example050

Produces output:

    [main] next=one
    [main] next=two
    [main] next=three
However, we can easily switch these emissions to happen on another thread using subscribeOn() . We can pass a Scheduler as an argument, which specifies where it gets a thread from. In this case we can pass subscribeOn() an argument of Schedulers.newThread() , so it will execute on a new thread for each Observer.
```java
Observable.just("one", "two", "three")
.subscribeOn(Schedulers.newThread())
.subscribe(next -> System.out.println("[" + Thread.currentThread().getName() + "] next=" + next));
TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(4);
```	
Example051

Produces output:

    [RxNewThreadScheduler-1] next=one
    [RxNewThreadScheduler-1] next=two
    [RxNewThreadScheduler-1] next=three
This way we can declare our Observable chain and an Observer, but then immediately move on without waiting for the emissions to finish. Those are now happening on a new thread named RxNewThreadScheduler-1 . Notice too we have to call TimUnit.SECONDS.sleep(4) afterwards to make the main thread sleep for 4 seconds. This gives our Observable a chance to fire all emissions before the program exits.
A critical behavior to note here is that all emissions are happening sequentially on a single RxNewThreadScheduler-1 thread. Emissions are strictly happening one-at-a-time on a single thread. There is no parallelization or racing to call onNext() throughout the chain. If this did occur, it would break the Observable contract.
subscribeOn() can be declared anywhere in the Observable chain, and it will communicate all the way up to the source what thread to fire emissions on. If you pointlessly declare multiple subscribeOn() operators in a chain, the leftmost one (closest to the source) will win.
In reality, you should be conservative about using Schedulers.newThread() as it creates a new thread for each Observer. You will notice that if we attach multiple Observers to this Observable, we are going to create a new thread for each Observer.
```java
Observable<String> sourceObservable = Observable.just("one", "two", "three", "four", "five")
.subscribeOn(Schedulers.newThread());
sourceObservable.subscribe(next -> System.out.println("Obserer1 [" + Thread.currentThread().getName() + "] next=" + next));
sourceObservable.subscribe(next -> System.out.println("Obserer2 [" + Thread.currentThread().getName() + "] next=" + next));
TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(2);
```
Example052

Produces output:

    Obserer1 [RxNewThreadScheduler-1] next=one
    Obserer2 [RxNewThreadScheduler-2] next=one
    Obserer2 [RxNewThreadScheduler-2] next=two
    Obserer1 [RxNewThreadScheduler-1] next=two
    Obserer2 [RxNewThreadScheduler-2] next=three
    Obserer1 [RxNewThreadScheduler-1] next=three
    Obserer2 [RxNewThreadScheduler-2] next=four
    Obserer1 [RxNewThreadScheduler-1] next=four
    Obserer2 [RxNewThreadScheduler-2] next=five
    Obserer1 [RxNewThreadScheduler-1] next=five
or output:

    Obserer1 [RxNewThreadScheduler-1] next=one
    Obserer1 [RxNewThreadScheduler-1] next=two
    Obserer2 [RxNewThreadScheduler-2] next=one
    Obserer1 [RxNewThreadScheduler-1] next=three
    Obserer2 [RxNewThreadScheduler-2] next=two
    Obserer1 [RxNewThreadScheduler-1] next=four
    Obserer2 [RxNewThreadScheduler-2] next=three
    Obserer1 [RxNewThreadScheduler-1] next=five
    Obserer2 [RxNewThreadScheduler-2] next=four
    Obserer2 [RxNewThreadScheduler-2] next=five   
or many more, depends on how thread interleaves
Now we have two threads, RxNewThreadScheduler-1 and RxNewThreadScheduler-2 . What if we had 100, or even 1000 Observers? This can easily happen if you are flatMapping to hundreds or thousands of Observables each with their own subscribeOn(Schedulers.newThread()) . Threads are very expensive and can tax your machine, so we want to constrain the number of threads that can be used at a time.
The most effective way to keep thread creation under control is to "reuse" threads. You can do this with the different Schedulers . A Scheduler is RxJava's equivalent to Java's standard Executor. You can create your own Scheduler by passing an Executor to the Schedulers.from() factory. But for most cases, it is better to use RxJava's standard Schedulers as they are optimized to be conservative and efficient for most cases.
#### Computation
If you are doing computation-intensive operations, you will likely want to use Schedulers.computation().
#### IO
If you are doing a lot of IO-related tasks, like sending web requests or database queries, these are much less taxing on the CPU and threads can be created more liberally. Schedulers.io() is suited for this kind of work.
#### Single
Single Thread Executor
#### JavaFX Scheduler
Finally, the JavaFxScheduler is packaged with the RxJavaFX library. It executes the emissions on the JavaFX thread so they can safely make modifications to a UI.
All RxJavaFX factories already emit on the JavaFxScheduler . Therefore, declaring a subscribeOn() against these sources will have no affect.
### Intervals
While we are talking about concurrency, it is worth mentioning there are other factories that already emit on a specific Scheduler . For instance, there are factories in both RxJava and RxJavaFX to emit at a specified time interval.
In RxJava, there is an Observable.interval() that will emit a consecutive Long at every specified time interval. By default, this runs on the Schedulers.computation() unless you specify a different one as a third argument.
Here is an application that will increment a Label every second.
```java
Label label = new Label();
StackPane hBox = new StackPane(label);
Scene scene = new Scene(hBox, 100, 100);
stage.setScene(scene);
stage.show();
Observable.interval(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS, JavaFxScheduler.platform()).map(String::valueOf).subscribe(label::setText);
```	
Example053

### observeOn()
A lot of people get confused by the difference between subscribeOn() and observeOn(), but the distinction is quite simple. A subsribeOn() instructs the source Observable what thread to emit  items on. However, the observeOn() switches emissions to a different thread at that point in the chain.
Exmaple054
```java
Observable.just("one", "two", "three")
.subscribeOn(Schedulers.computation())
.doOnNext(next -> System.out.println("[" + Thread.currentThread().getName() + "] next=" + next))
.observeOn(Schedulers.io())
.doOnNext(next -> System.out.println("[" + Thread.currentThread().getName() + "] next=" + next))
.observeOn(Schedulers.computation())
.doOnNext(next -> System.out.println("[" + Thread.currentThread().getName() + "] next=" + next))
.subscribe(next -> System.out.println("Observer[" + Thread.currentThread().getName() + "] next=" + next));
TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(4);
```
Produces output:
```
[RxComputationThreadPool-1] next=one
[RxComputationThreadPool-1] next=two
[RxComputationThreadPool-1] next=three
[RxCachedThreadScheduler-1] next=one
[RxCachedThreadScheduler-1] next=two
[RxCachedThreadScheduler-1] next=three
[RxComputationThreadPool-2] next=one
Observer[RxComputationThreadPool-2] next=one
[RxComputationThreadPool-2] next=two
Observer[RxComputationThreadPool-2] next=two
[RxComputationThreadPool-2] next=three
Observer[RxComputationThreadPool-2] next=three
```
Our source emits on RxComputationThreadPool because we instructed it using 

    subscribeOn(Schedulers.computation())

Every source emission is sent on said thread in order. After that we call

    observeOn(Schedulers.io())
It creates kind of Observer which collects all pervious emissions and push them serially on a new thread - RxCachedThreadScheduler. After that we switch the thread one more time and finally our emissions get consumed by the Observer. Notice that the notion of concurrency does not appear anywhere in the chain, as said before.
Let's check how the hot Observables behave.
Example055
```java
StackPane stackPane = new StackPane();
Scene scene = new Scene(stackPane, 400, 400);
stage.setScene(scene);
stage.show();
JavaFxObservable.eventsOf(stackPane, MouseEvent.MOUSE_MOVED)
.doOnNext(moveEvent -> System.out.println("[" + Thread.currentThread().getName() + "] next=[x" + moveEvent.getX() + ", y=" + moveEvent.getY() + "]"))
.observeOn(Schedulers.computation())
.subscribe(moveEvent -> System.out.println("Observer[" + Thread.currentThread().getName() + "] next=[x" + moveEvent.getX() + ", y=" + moveEvent.getY() + "]"));
```
Produces output:

    [JavaFX Application Thread] next=[x4.0, y=240.0]
    [JavaFX Application Thread] next=[x15.0, y=236.0]
    Observer[RxComputationThreadPool-1] next=[x4.0, y=240.0]
    Observer[RxComputationThreadPool-1] next=[x15.0, y=236.0]
    [JavaFX Application Thread] next=[x30.0, y=234.0]
    Observer[RxComputationThreadPool-1] next=[x30.0, y=234.0]
    [JavaFX Application Thread] next=[x40.0, y=233.0]
    Observer[RxComputationThreadPool-1] next=[x40.0, y=233.0]
    [JavaFX Application Thread] next=[x56.0, y=230.0]
    Observer[RxComputationThreadPool-1] next=[x56.0, y=230.0]
Analizing two first and subsequent emissions gives you and idea that behaviour is exactly the same. There is no chance that emission1 at time1 will overtake emission2 at time2 where 
time1 < time2.
In JavaFX, the most common useage of observeOn() is to put emissions back on the JavaFX thread after a compution or IO operation finishes from another thread. Say you wanted to import some expensive data on Schedulers.io() and collect it in a List . Once it is ready, you want to move that List emission to the JavaFX thread to feed a ListView . That is perfectly doable with an observeOn().
Example056
```java
ListView<String> listView = new ListView<>();
Scene scene = new Scene(listView);
stage.setScene(scene);
stage.show();
Observable.just("one", "two", "three")
.observeOn(Schedulers.io())
.doOnNext(next -> System.out.println("[" + Thread.currentThread().getName() + "] next=" + next))
.observeOn(JavaFxScheduler.platform())
.doOnNext(next -> System.out.println("[" + Thread.currentThread().getName() + "] next=" + next))
.subscribe(listView.getItems()::add);
```
Produces output:

    [RxCachedThreadScheduler-1] next=one
    [RxCachedThreadScheduler-1] next=two
    [RxCachedThreadScheduler-1] next=three
    [JavaFX Application Thread] next=one
    [JavaFX Application Thread] next=two
    [JavaFX Application Thread] next=three
#### delay()
This all happens a bit too fast to see this occuring, so let's exaggerate this example and emulate a long-running database query or request. Use the delay() operator to delay the emissions by 3 seconds. Note that delay() subscribes on the Schedulers.computation() by default, so having a subscribeOn() no longer has any effect. But we can pass the Schedulers.io() as a third argument to make it use an IO thread instead.
Example057
```java
ListView<String> listView = new ListView<>();
Scene scene = new Scene(listView);
stage.setScene(scene);
stage.show();
Observable.just("one", "two", "three")
.doOnNext(next -> System.out.println("[" + Thread.currentThread().getName() + "] next=" + next))
.delay(3, TimeUnit.SECONDS, Schedulers.io())
.doOnNext(next -> System.out.println("[" + Thread.currentThread().getName() + "] next=" + next))
.observeOn(JavaFxScheduler.platform())
.doOnNext(next -> System.out.println("[" + Thread.currentThread().getName() + "] next=" + next))
.subscribe(listView.getItems()::add);
```
Produces output:

    [JavaFX Application Thread] next=one
    [JavaFX Application Thread] next=two
    [JavaFX Application Thread] next=three
    [RxCachedThreadScheduler-1] next=one
    [RxCachedThreadScheduler-1] next=two
    [RxCachedThreadScheduler-1] next=three
    [JavaFX Application Thread] next=one
    [JavaFX Application Thread] next=two
    [JavaFX Application Thread] next=three
Notice that our UI is empty for 3 seconds before it is finally populated. The data importing and collecting into a List happens on the IO thread, and then it is safely emitted back on the JavaFX thread where it is populated into the ListView . The JavaFX thread does not hold up the UI from displaying due to this operation keeping it busy. If we had more controls we would see the UI is completely interactive as well during this background operation.
It's a huge progress in comparision to processing all data on Fx thread, but not really what we expect out of well working application. If your emissions represent long-running database query or request then we got a problem because first request must finish to run a second request and all the way down to last emission.
#### Chaining multiple observeOn() calls
It is also not uncommon to use multiple observeOn() calls. Here is a more reallifeexample: let's say you want to create an application that displays a text response (such as JSON) from a URL. This has the potential to create an unrespsonsive application that freezes while it is fetching the request. But using an observeOn() we can switch this work from the FX thread to an IO therad, then call another observeOn() afterwards to put it back on the FX thread.
Example058
```java
Button button = new Button("Send request");
TextArea textArea = new TextArea();
textArea.setWrapText(true);
VBox vBox = new VBox(textArea, button);
Scene scene = new Scene(vBox);
stage.setScene(scene);
stage.show();

JavaFxObservable.actionEventsOf(button)
.observeOn(Schedulers.io())
.map(actionEvent -> request("https://api.github.com/users/pkrysztofiak"))
.observeOn(JavaFxScheduler.platform())
.subscribe(textArea::setText);
```
You can find out yourself that during request UI is fully responsive.
Of course, you can click the "Submit" Button multiple times and that could queue up the requests in an undesirable way. But at least the work is kept off the UI thread.
### Parallelization
Did you know the flatMap() (as well as flatMapSingle() and flatMapMaybe() ) is actually a concurrency tool? RxJava by default does not do parallelization, so effectively there is no way to parallelize an Observable . As we have seen, subscribeOn() and observeOn() merely move emissions from one thread to another thread, not one thread to many threads. However, you can leverage flatMap() to create several Observables parallelizing emissions on different threads.
Example059
```java
Observable.just("one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven", "eight", "nine", "ten")
.doOnNext(next -> System.out.println("[" + Thread.currentThread().getName() + "] next=" + next))
.flatMap(number -> Observable.just(number).subscribeOn(Schedulers.computation()).map(Example059::process))
.subscribe(next -> System.out.println("Observer [" + Thread.currentThread().getName() + "] next=" + next));
TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(30);
```
Run the code expirince parallelization.
### Switching, throttling and buffering
In the previous chapter, we learned that RxJava makes concurrency accessible and fairly trivial to accomplish. But being able to compose concurrency easily enables us to do much more with RxJava.
In UI development, users will inevitably click things that kick off long-running processes. Even if you have concurrency in place, users that rapidly select UI inputs can kick of expensive processes, and those processes will start to queue up undesirably. Other times, we may want to group up rapid emissions to make them a single unit, such as typing keystrokes. There are tools to effectively overcome all these problems, and we will cover them in this chapter.
##### Task013
There are two ListView\<String> next to each other. First has predefined values "Alpha", "Beta", "Gamma", "Delta". On every selection change present String from the first list as letter per cell in the second list. Click on "Alpha" should create five cells in second ListView with values "A", "l", "p", "h", "a". Use regex "(?!^)" to split String into characters.
##### Task014
In task013 this is a pretty quick computation which hardly keeps the JavaFX thread busy. But in the real world, running database queries or HTTP requests can take awhile. The last thing we want is for these rapid inputs to create a queue of requests that will quickly make the application unusable as it works through the queue. Let's emulate this by using the delay() operator. Remember that the delay() operator already specifies a subscribeOn() internally, but we can specify an argument which Scheduler it uses. Let's put it in the IO Scheduler. The Observer must receive each emission on the JavaFX thread, so be sure to observeOn() the JavaFX Scheduler before the emission goes to the Observer .

Now if we click several items on the top ListView , you will notice a 3-second lag before the letters show up on the bottom ListView . This emulates longrunning requests for each click, and now we have these requests queuing up and causing the bottom ListView to go berserk, trying to display each previous request before it gets to the current one. Obviously, this is undesirable. We likely want to kill previous requests when a new one comes in, and this is simple to do.
Example060
```java
JavaFxObservable.valuesOf(listView.getSelectionModel().selectedItemProperty())
.switchMap(letter -> Observable.fromArray(letter.split("(?!^)")).delay(3, TimeUnit.SECONDS, Schedulers.io()).toList().toObservable())
.observeOn(JavaFxScheduler.platform())
.subscribe(lettersListView.getItems()::setAll);
```	
The switchMap() works identically to any variant of flatMap() , but it will only chase after the latest user input and kill any previous requests. In other words, it is only chasing after the latest Observable derived from the latest emission, and unsubscribing any previous requests. The switchMap() is a powerful utility to create responsive and resilient UI's, and is the perfect way to handle click-happy users!
You can also use the switchMap() to cancel long-running or infinite processes using a neat little trick with Observable.empty() . For instance, a ToggleButton has a true/false state depending on whether it is selected. When you emit its false state, you can return an empty Observable to kill the previous processing Observable , as shown below. When the ToggleButton is selected, it will kick off an Observable.interval() that emits a consecutive integer every 10 milliseconds. But unselecting the ToggleButton will cause the flatMap() to switch to an Observable.empty() , killing and unsubscribing from the Observable.interval()
Example061
```java
ToggleButton toggleButton = new ToggleButton("Start");
Label label = new Label("0");
HBox hBox = new HBox(toggleButton, label);
Scene scene = new Scene(hBox);
stage.setScene(scene);
stage.show();

JavaFxObservable.valuesOf(toggleButton.selectedProperty())
.switchMap(selected -> {
	if (selected) {
		toggleButton.setText("Stop");
		return Observable.interval(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS).map(next -> next + 1);
	} else {
		label.setText("0");
		toggleButton.setText("Start");
		return Observable.empty();
	}
})
.observeOn(JavaFxScheduler.platform())
.map(String::valueOf)
.subscribe(label::setText);
```
The switchMap() can come in handy for any situation where you want to switch from one Observable source to another.
##### Task015
Modify above example and make work the Stop button like Pause rather than Reset.
##### Task016
Create an app which pins a point whenever user keeps mouse cursor still for more than 2 seconds. Call method pinPoint() on described action.
### Buffering
We may want to collect emissions into a List , but doing so on a batching condition so several lists are emitted. The buffer() operators help accomplish this, and they have several overload flavors. The simplest buffer() specifies the number of emissions that will be collected into a List before that List is pushed forward, and then it will start a new one. In this example, emissions will be grouped up in batches of 10.
#### Example062
```java
Observable.range(0, 100)
.buffer(10)
.subscribe(System.out::println);
```	
Produces output:

    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
    [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]
    [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]
    [30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39]
    [40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49]
    [50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59]
    [60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69]
    [70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79]
    [80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89]
    [90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99]
There are other flavors of buffer() . Another will collect emissions based on a specified time cutoff. If you have an Observable emitting at an interval of 300 milliseconds, you can buffer them into a List at every second.
#### Example063
```java
	Observable.interval(300, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)
	.buffer(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
	.subscribe(System.out::println);
```
Produces output:

    [0, 1, 2]
    [3, 4, 5]
    [6, 7, 8, 9]
    [10, 11, 12]
    [13, 14, 15]
    [16, 17, 18, 19]
    [20, 21, 22]
    [23, 24, 25]
    [26, 27, 28, 29]
    [30, 31, 32]
### Throattling    
When you have a rapidly firing Observable , you may just want to emit the first or last emission within a specified scope. For example, you can use throttleLast() to emit the last emission for each fixed time interval.
```java
Observable.interval(300, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)
.throttleLast(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
.subscribe(System.out::println);
```	
Produces output:

    2
    5
    9
    12
    15
    19
    22
    25
    28
    32
